This site has an incredibly new look as of today. I have completely re-designed the site based on a tutorial from Jonathan McGlone. The site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on GitHub Pages. The [tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) was absolutely incredible. It walked you through while knowing exactly when to let you do things yourself. Johnathen was excellent at knowing exactly where people might run into typos and issues, drawing your eye to anything you were likely to miss when following along.

I'm going to use this site as a place to document my journey from this point out. I hope to periodically update my information and blog with interesting developments as frequently as possible. In the meantime, please feel free to look around the site to get to know me a little bit better.

The search for a new job is one of the most loathed times in a developer's life. Interview challenges are particularly rigorous in this industry, and companies have an ever-growing pool of candidates to fuel more selective behaviors. The challenges developers and engineers face in finding a job are grand and diverse. This is particularly true if the candidate is graduating, and is feeling the pressure of obtaining a job straight out of school.

I was lucky enough to get an offer from my first-choice company. I'll be starting in June (after a much-needed vacation to celebrate the departure from what may be my last place of education), and I'm overly excited. I thought that I might take the opportunity to try to share a little bit more about what made my search successful. I'm hopeful that by doing this, I can help at least one person in their search for a job, especially if that search is happening with graduation on the heels.

My first attempt at searching was doomed from the start. I believe that this is the case for most people. The general feeling I've gotten from forums for devs and engineers looking for entry and junior-level jobs is one of loathing and frustration. If you go to some of these sites ([Reddit's CS Career Questions sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/) is a good example), you'll find an ecclectic collection of questions and complaints about prospective and current jobs. You may find visualized metrics of people's career searches, in which they will have hundreds of application attempts listed (most of these applications will have been ignored by the prospective companies). This was the lens through which my first search was conducted. I did what people said in the comments, I prepared for rejection, and took a shotgun approach with about a dozen companies I had barely heard of. Thankfully, my first choice in companies was not applied for in this wave. In fact, I did not even know it was my first choice yet!

So I asked myself what went wrong? What did these companies have in common, and why was the result always the same?

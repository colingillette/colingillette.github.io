Welcome! I hope that you enjoy reading my second attempt at keeping up with a blog. I hope that this attempt is more successful, as I plan on creating a completely new blog on [Substack](https://substack.com/). The page will be called [Alexander's Corner](https://alexanderscorner.substack.com/p/coming-soon), and will explore my thoughts and process as I develop my first video game.

I will post my initial updates and theories to this site and **Alexander's Corner**, but eventually the updates specific to that project will remain on that feed. An in-depth exploration of what that project is trying to accomplish will be uploaded soon. In the meantime, this post will serve as a promise of things to come, and a celebration of this site's second take.

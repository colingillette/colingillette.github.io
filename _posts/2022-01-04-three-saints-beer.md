Like many men my age, craft beer has always been an interest of mine. Lately, I've been introducing more diverse and interesting beers to my friends and family. Recently, I was complimented on my ability to recommend beers that people enjoy based on our shared experiences. That got me thinking about my other interests.

I have also always been a fan of watching Music and Video Game critics and analysts on YouTube. I realized that these creators also shared a passion for recommending good content in their covered industry. They also brought to the table a certain level of experience and pedigree in their fields that gave them credibility as judges of subjective topics.

I realized fairly quickly that I did not bring this level of experience to beer. I understand enough to generally know what I'm talking about, but when I'm recommending beers to my friends I certainly don't back my statements with the same language and knowledge of a [Cicerone](https://www.cicerone.org/). I think that's okay though. Perhaps beer recommendations for people should come from someone whose understanding, language, and background is much the same as their own. The wine world's historical adoption of exclusivity created a barrier to entry for great wines that is only recently being broken down by new-age [Sommeliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sommelier) like [Andre Mack](https://www.instagram.com/andrehmack/). When a pallette for good drinks requires too great of a sunk cost, Americans are going to stick to the cheap, industrialized national brands. If you're a wine drinker you know what they are, and the same has been occurring in the beer world. Only in the last few decades have craft and small batch brewers really broken into the American pallette.

Thus we came to the idea: beer recommendations for amateur craft beer drinkers. An end goal of trying to better the flavor pallete of the general beer-drinking community in a way that's easily accessible. And who better than an amateur craft beer drinker to kick off the concept? Especially one who has just recently moved to one of the most established beer markets in the country.

I live in St. Peters: a town in St. Charles County, which makes up the Northwestern end of the St. Louis Metropolitan area. Thus Three Saints was born. Just how I live in this nested set of three towns of Saints, I would focus my beer recommendations starting with St. Peters and the nearby brewers, eventually moving out to St. Charles County and St. Louis as well.

At the moment, I am working on understanding the full offerings of a few breweries very close to me. Three Saints will follow their new offerings, and attempt to make recommendations for their full tap lists. These first breweries are: Third Wheel Brewing in St. Peters, Exit 6 Brewery in St. Charles, Shortleaf Brewing in O'Fallon, and Six Mile Bridge in Maryland Heights.

That's not to say Three Saints will only recommend beers from these breweries. We're going to use common craft beers from brewers across the city and the nation that drinkers may be familiar with to help make helpful comparisons.

St. Louis has one of the most thriving and interconnected networks of brewers in the nation. They are highly supportive of each other, the city, and good beer. But in my short time in the area I have noticed the same notion of fraternity among beer creators doesn't exist among the population's beer drinkers. Different people have strong preferences and aversions to certain breweries, and I think that crafting a supportive community of beer drinkers will benefit everyone. A single bad experience can unfairly turn a beer-drinker off from a brewer, and I hope that Three Saints can start to prevent that by crafting recommendations.

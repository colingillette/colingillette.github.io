I am returning to my roots. I began my college career as a Finance major, and hoped to be an analyst for an investment bank upon graduation. Unfortunately, the resources at my school were geared toward the sales side of Finance. While there is great money to be made in that field, it involved far too many internships selling life insurance to friends and family. I switched my major to Computer Information Systems and have been a successful software developer and consultant for the last few years.

In the last few months, I have been doing research into the stock market. I am going to begin investing heavily, and I want to record my thoughts as I go. I forgot how much I enjoyed this type of financial analysis. I will begin to share my financial philosophy, successes, and failures.

I hope to become a better writer as I go.

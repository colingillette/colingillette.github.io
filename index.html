    <h1>Hello, I'm Colin Gillette!</h1>
    <p>
        I'm a developer and designer based out of <a href="https://www.springfieldmo.org/">Springfield, MO</a>.

        In short, that means I've dedicated myself to trying to find creative solutions to technlogocial problems.

        I am working on creating a small video game, and am documenting the process at <a href="https://alexanderscorner.substack.com/">Alexander's Corner</a>.
        The site will also explore lessons learned from the the industry, and my personal theories on game design. Check it out if you're interested! 
        This site's blog will host the early entries in the series that go over the basics of the project.
